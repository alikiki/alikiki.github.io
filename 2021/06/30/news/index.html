			<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Louis Pasteur said "where observation is concerned, chance favors only the prepared mind." For me, there are three components to intellectual growth: observation, intake, and reflection. Observation is by far the component that I pay the least attention to, and this page is an attempt to give more effort to observation.</p>

<p>In other words, I'm just trying to trick myself into not being a theoretical-head-in-the-clouds geek. Mind you, the news articles listed here are not the most important or interesting, but more a reflection of what I am able to address.</p>

Microcontrollers [2] now take 26.5 weeks - a drastic departure from the usual 6-9 weeks - while power management chip lead times have reduced.</li>

	<li>A number of articles that discuss Apple's announcement regarding CSAM:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/apples-mistake/">Ben Thompson</a> argues Apple is betraying its privacy values by confusing capability vs. policy, and cloud vs. on-device.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/hunting-predators">Antonio Garcia Martinez</a> is skeptical about the reported false positive rate of the photo-matching algorithm(s), and how greater power implies greater responsibility (and greater attention to the means of channeling this reponsibility).</li>

		</ul>

		Overall, Ben Thompson's delineation of capability vs policy, and cloud vs. on-device is spot-on. The general arguments of the anti-Apple-policy crowd can be separated into 1. the slippery slope that these photo-matching algorithms could lead to if the definition of problematic photos expands and 2. Apple's newfound power in accessing on-device data, coupled with reporting process, demands greater responsibilty (which will probably be ignored).

In an effort to compete with China's goals of industrial self-sufficiency, the Biden administration plans to pump government support into critical sectors such as semiconductors, batteries, specialized minerals and pharmaceutical ingredients. The U.S. has traditionally led in innovation but lagged in production, preferring to outsource to other countries - no longer. It now aims to gain more control over the overall supply chain.

	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/NatureBiotech/status/1420795633955389444?s=20">Scientists</a> develop DNA polymerase capable of encoding L-DNA. [1] <div class="marginnote">[1] DNA polymerase is the enzyme responsible for DNA replication. </div>As far as essential molecules for life are concerned, they follow a curious phenomenon called homochirality; roughly speaking, objects have "handedness". For example, most amino acids are L-chiral, while sugars are D-chiral. [2] <div class="marginnote">[2] Think: L = left, D = droit. L-chiral is left-handed, D-chiral is right-handed. The question of the homochirality's necessity is off-topic, but there seems to be some evidence that homochirality aids in information storage and reduces entropy barriers.</div> DNA, as it occurs in nature, is D-chiral. However, Tsinghua scientists have re-engineered DNA polymerase to encode L-DNA, the mirror image of D-DNA. Furthermore, this L-DNA is resistant to biodegradation i.e. it remains amplifiable and sequenceable after a nontrivial span of time. The greater implications of this technology is an explosion of mirror biology systems, which could lead to fantastic solutions for climate change or other significant central issues.

			<li><a href="https://lillianli.substack.com/p/let-the-bullets-fly-for-a-while">@lillianmli</a>'s <i>Let The Bullets Fly For A While</i>. She contends that China's recent crackdown fits into its regulatory pattern innovate-then-regulate, making the hot question not "why?", but "why now?".</li>

		The common theme running through all these arguments is a point made in Dan Wang's <a href="https://danwang.co/2020-letter/">2020 letter</a>: China's future is focused on industralizing, manufacturing, and the real economy.

Thorium as found in nature (Th-232) is fertile, but Th-232 transmutes into the fissile Uranium-233 when bombarded with high-energy neutrons. In a Thorium MSR, thorium is dissolved into liquid salt, which is then sent into a reactor chamber. The liquid salt mixture ensures that the excess neutrons are high-energy neutrons, hence effectively 'waking the thorium beast'. The MSR's implications include low water requirements and effective usage of fertile elements. [1][2]</li>

Only when the resulting CPI continued to rise at a double-digit rate did Burns acknowledge America's inflation problem.

Using drones may not usher in a technological revolution, but it reminds me of Carlota Perez's <i>Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital</i>; in her model, technological revolutions generally start at certain cores (US, Britain, etc.), then diffuse to the peripheries. This appears to demonstrate the opposite phenomenon. Ghana's restrictions against drones may have been more lax, hence providing a nice training ground for Zipline.</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3de60b3b-fa83-466a-b38d-d5cde3680b36">Robinhood</a> faced to pay $70 million to resolve allegations that it misled customers. The psychology surrounding money is fascinating; at least in America, having a lot of money is synonymous with a good life, and I think the behaviors seen on Robinhood are in-line with this thesis.</li>

Sinotype III was an Apple II with a modified word processor and operating system; it was developed (strangely?) by the Graphic Arts Education and Research Foundation (GARF), an American foundation.</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/chinas-didi-raises-4-billion-us-ipo-source-2021-06-29/">Didi Chuxing</a>, a Chinese ride-hailing company, to raise an expected $4 billion in US IPO. A lot of Didi's ride-sharing comes from taxi-hailing rather than private-car sharing (similar to Kakao Taxi), and with Meituan and Ele.me already popular in the Chinese food delivery market, it'll be interesting to see how Didi grows.</li>

	<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/family-app-life360-announces-2-1m-investment-round-from-celebs-and-influencers/">Life360</a> announces a new investment round of $2.1 million. This trend of wanting to know the locations of your families and friends is an interesting one. I remember it started back in the 2010s with Snapchat announcing their locations feature. Since then, I've had multiple friends ask me to install location-sharing apps, but I never understood why someone would willingly give away his/her location. Maybe the placement of a social graph in physical space?</li>

As the name suggests, it strives for universal basic income by bypassing government regulation with technology. The relationship between centralized and decentralized systems, and the analogous tension between centralized and decentralized <b>power</b> comes to mind here.</li>
