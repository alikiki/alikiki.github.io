			<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Louis Pasteur said "where observation is concerned, chance favors only the prepared mind." For me, there are three components to intellectual growth: observation, intake, and reflection. Observation is by far the component that I pay the least attention to, and this page is an attempt to give more effort to observation.</p>

<p>In other words, I'm just trying to trick myself into not being a theoretical-head-in-the-clouds geek. Mind you, the news articles listed here are not the most important or interesting, but more a reflection of what I am able to address.</p>

With the Chinese government banning cryptocurrency mining over alleged illicit coal mining, many have been forced to seek power for their mining operations elsewhere. One favorite destination is Kazakhstan, where miners can get electrocity for as low as 3 cents per kilo-watt hour. However, Kazakhstan's power potential is waning, given its popularity and its lack of development in energy capacity over the past twenty years. Additionally, some miners are using this opportunity to investigate greener energy sources.</li>

I first encountered this relationship between attacker, defender, and customer in cryptography. From the defender's (Amazon, Ebay, etc.) point of view, you don't want your service to be too easy to penetrate. But you also don't want to increase the friction so much that people are discouraged from using your service entirely. </div>

Fraudsters are taking advantage of the difficulties in proof of correct delivery and reception; for example, in the "item not received" fraud, a fraudster will falsely claim that he/she did not receive his/her ordered item, consequently receiving a refund. E-commerce frauds have taken off during the pandemic especially, for social distancing measures have decreased contact between delivery drivers and receivers. Some fraud operations even provide step-by-step manuals for committing these frauds. At the same time, fraud prevention services are working overtime to create effective deterrence methods. [1]</li>

Given that both Sudan and Egypt depend on the Nile for farming and energy generation, GERD's second phase of filling threatens to sour relations even further. For one, the GERD retains silt, but a momentary opening of its lower gates in November caused heavy silt to block the turbines of Sudan's Roseires dam - this lead to power outages throughout Sudan. Drought and flooding remain principal concerns also.</li>

	<div class="marginnote">[1] In <i>Seeing Like A State</i>, James C. Scott mentions scientific forestry and how the compression of natural complexity into a more administrative, controlled form led to uncontrollable setbacks. However, as similar as these pollination robots sound to scientific forestry, technology can be used to bypass artificial forcing-complexity-into-boxes altogether (given that the algorithm can recognize natural complexity). Nonetheless, whether this forced intrusion into the natural feedback loop between insects and plant reproduction is also ignoring levels of complexity is worth thinking about. </div>

With the declining insect population, farmers are looking for ways to decrease their dependence on bees to pollinate their crops. Arugga AI Farming, an AI-first-farming-second startup based in Israel, creates robots that identify and pollinate flowers that are ready for pollination.

With a big question mark surrounding consumer demand, coffee prices at the consumer level could be affected.

This is an older opinion piece from May 2021, but highlights bigger themes surrounding inflation this time around. Roach remembers Arthur Burns' philosophy surrounding inflation - Burns believed that price trends are largely affected by transitory noise that has nothing to do with monetary policy. Hence he sought to reduce the consumer price index (CPI) to products that were independent of noise, at one point excluding energy and food products. Only when the resulting CPI continued to rise at a double-digit rate did Burns acknowledge America's inflation problem.

	<p>This highlights the dangers of cherry-picking: picking "nicer" data points to see a desired result like a lower significance level. Furthermore, the delineation between COVID and normalcy can be dangerous; treating COVID as merely a passing phase encourages a Burns-esque philosophy that increases in various consumer products will disappear once COVID is "over".</p></li>

Zipline first attacked the African space by making strides in medical supply lines, using drones to deliver vaccines and medicines to local hospitals. Using drones may not usher in a technological revolution, but it reminds me of Carlota Perez's <i>Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital</i>; in her model, technological revolutions generally start at certain cores (US, Britain, etc.), then diffuse to the peripheries. This appears to demonstrate the opposite phenomenon. Ghana's restrictions against drones may have been more lax, hence providing a nice training ground for Zipline.</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3de60b3b-fa83-466a-b38d-d5cde3680b36">Robinhood</a> faced to pay $70 million to resolve allegations that it misled customers. The psychology surrounding money is fascinating; at least in America, having a lot of money is synonymous with a good life, and I think the behaviors seen on Robinhood are in-line with this thesis.</li>

Sinotype III was an Apple II with a modified word processor and operating system; it was developed (strangely?) by the Graphic Arts Education and Research Foundation (GARF), an American foundation.</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/chinas-didi-raises-4-billion-us-ipo-source-2021-06-29/">Didi Chuxing</a>, a Chinese ride-hailing company, to raise an expected $4 billion in US IPO. A lot of Didi's ride-sharing comes from taxi-hailing rather than private-car sharing (similar to Kakao Taxi), and with Meituan and Ele.me already popular in the Chinese food delivery market, it'll be interesting to see how Didi grows.</li>

	<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/family-app-life360-announces-2-1m-investment-round-from-celebs-and-influencers/">Life360</a> announces a new investment round of $2.1 million. This trend of wanting to know the locations of your families and friends is an interesting one. I remember it started back in the 2010s with Snapchat announcing their locations feature. Since then, I've had multiple friends ask me to install location-sharing apps, but I never understood why someone would willingly give away his/her location. Maybe the placement of a social graph in physical space?</li>

As the name suggests, it strives for universal basic income by bypassing government regulation with technology. The relationship between centralized and decentralized systems, and the analogous tension between centralized and decentralized <b>power</b> comes to mind here.</li>
