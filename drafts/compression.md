### on the resolution of contradiction

Since high school, I've had an obsession with contradictions and paradoxes. If I had to pinpoint any one thing to think about for the rest of time, it'd be intersections of contradictions. 

From a purely logical standpoint, contradictions shouldn't exist in the natural world. Yet we hear them all the time, summarized in captivating symbols or short aphorisms: "empty space is what makes a bowl useful", "be strong yet weak", etc. 

[^1]: To be clear, I have no problem with Taoist philosophy, but I hate that it's been bastardized by modern "gurus". 

Yet why are they so ubiquitous, in spite of their impossibility? 

Some questions to whet your appetite: how is it possible to get linear behavior out of circular motion, and vice versa? How is it possible for a network to be both decentralized and centralized? How is it possible for  a process to be linear and non-linear? 

What I show below is more a useful analytical framework for understanding contradictions than a concrete analysis of complexity.

## Frames of reference

Many types of contradictions can be resolved by looking at different frames of reference (FOR). There may be other types of contradictions that don't buckle under the "FOR attack" but I've found this idea to be helpful for pinpointing what causes contradictory behavior. 

An object can simultaneously exhibit one property at one FOR but the opposite property at another FOR. The key insight is that descriptions apply only for specific FORs. I can call Chicago and New York "close" when looking at a map, but when I ditch the map and go walking from Chicago to New York, Chicago and New York are "far apart". This means that when describing something, we need to ensure that we include which FOR we are in. 

### Size variation

My favorite method of changing FORs is by altering the size of the frame window a.k.a. size variation. For example, a circle is circular when viewed through a large frame window, but the circle "straightens out" into a line at a sufficiently small frame window. In this way, a circle is both linear and circular. 

Although deceivingly simple and almost stupid, this idea isn't completely useless. In fact, a curved object exhibiting both circular and linear properties by way of varying FOR size is the inspiration for using derivatives to approximate differentiable curves. Generally, linearity lends itself to easier computation, so having a linear approximation for a complex, bendy curve can be incredibly useful (given a reasonable error margin, of course).

### Positive-negative variation

Size isn't the only way to vary FORs. Another useful variation is the positive-negative variation. 

The name of this variation derives from the artistic notion of positive and negative space. The positive space of the *Mona Lisa* consists of the Mona Lisa herself, while the negative space is the faded trees and hills in the background. 

One of the methods for apply positive-negative variation is breaking an object or concept down into its consituent parts. Especially in social contexts, these constituent parts come together and form **relationships** in order to form the whole. The "positive space" of the object then consists of the parts themselves, while the "negative space" consists of the relationships between the parts. 

Positive-negative variation is easily visualized by taking any network and breaking it down into its nodes and edges. The positive space is just the nodes without the edges, and likewise the negative space is the edges without the nodes. From a positive FOR, the properties of the nodes become visible. The negative FOR reveals how nodes behave when they clash with other nodes. I've always said it and I'll say it again: "people in isolation are simple, but people in relations are complicated." 

### Relative-absolute variation

You can put different variations together to get new flavors. The relative-absolute variation is one such variation - it is the combination of size and positive-negative variation in that it is positive-negative variation viewed on a micro-scale. The insight for relative-absolute variation is that, except for things that live in complete isolation,

[^relative-absolute]: I can't think of one... can you?

 most objects or concepts have a relative and an absolute definition. The former defines by way of relationships to other things, whereas the latter defines the thing in its own terms. In other words, a relative definition is dependent on other things, while an absolute definition is independent and can stand on its own. For example, my own relative definitions would be "first son of - and -, brother of -", while my absolute definition would be "homo sapien".  

The absolute definitions automatically imply any relative definitions, if and when the absolute definitions exist. Wouldn't it be nice if we had absolute definitions for every object and concept, then? Sadly, absolute definitions rarely exist in the social sphere, so relative definitions are all we can work with. 

The idea is that as the pixels of a screen get smaller, the overall picture becomes clearer and the divisions between the pixels become less obvious. 

I'm sure as 

## Caveat: cross-contaminated FORs

Sometimes, descriptions carry over into other FORs. 

## Case studies

Most of these case studies are very math-flavored, so I've marked the case studies that are particularly math-heavy with an asterisk.

### Case study 1: Fractals

I'll say it: fractals are the purest, most beautiful contradictions. Many fractals exhibit non-sensical properties: Sierpinski's triangle has zero area, the Cantor middle-thirds set is uncountably infinite but has length zero. 

They are both simple and complex - simple in that any fractal can be constructed by repeating the rule of self-similarity across all scales and locations. Complex in that this simple rule creates unimaginable detail. Somehow, the fractal is more than the sum of its parts. 

Fractals can be analyzed using size variation and positive-negative variation. Size  variation analysis isn't too fruitful. 

The purest, most beautiful contradiction that can be resolved using size variation is fractals. Fractals are both simple and complex i.e. contradictory objects. At the macro-level, fractals are extraordinarily complex and exhibit non-intuitive properties. Sierpinski's triangle has zero area, but can be drawn to be any size; the Cantor set is an uncountably infinite set with Lebesgue measure zero. However, zooming into any fractal reveals the fundamental fractal rule: self-similarity. The infinite, simple iteration of self-similarity across all different sizes creates complexity. Somehow, the fractal is more than the sum of its parts. (use positive-negative variation here)

Durkheim famously said that society is *sui generis*. Marx famously said that
