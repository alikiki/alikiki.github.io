&lt;p&gt;Louis Pasteur said &quot;where observation is concerned, chance favors only the prepared mind.&quot; For me, there are three components to intellectual growth: observation, intake, and reflection. Observation is by far the component that I pay the least attention to, and this page is an attempt to give more effort to observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, I&apos;m just trying to trick myself into not being a theoretical-head-in-the-clouds geek. Mind you, the news articles listed here are not the most important or interesting, but more a reflection of what I am able to address.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[2] I mentioned during the Coop ransomware attacks that implementing technology is hard. A potential weakpoint here is then pipeline operators resorting to third-parties to construct their security systems. An attack on the third-party alone could be enough to hit a number of critical targets (although security systems are probably built bespoke so as to prevent standardization).&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-pipeline-cybersecurity-requirements-issued-by-biden-administration-11626786802&quot;&gt;Biden administration&lt;/a&gt; releases cybersecurity measures for U.S. pipelines. The directive also disclosed previously classified information that China, between 2011 and 2013, had compromised many U.S. oil and natural gas pipeline systems. In light of the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack and the alleged Chinese cyberattack on Microsoft, the Biden administration appears to be taking a more active stance on protecting critical infrastructure systems. [1][2]&lt;/li&gt;

The deal includes various checks on Moscow and aid to Ukraine. Ukraine and Poland are unhappy, asserting that the pipeline is a serious security threat.&lt;/li&gt;

The Russian pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea, has been controversial considering its potential geopolitical and strategic implications. On the American side, the pipeline may increase Europe&apos;s already-high dependence on Russia for gas and allow the Kremlin to further bully Ukraine. [1] On the German and Russian side, the NS2 will double the amount of natural gas directly transported to Germany. Despite their continued opposition, the Americans concluded that bruising relations with Germany and other allies are a greater consequence. Under the agreement, U.S. and Germany will invest in Ukraine&apos;s green infrastructure and ensure that Ukraine continues to receive its transit fees. [2]&lt;/li&gt;

UAE&apos;s baseline has increased by 332,000 bpd, and both Russia and Saudi Arabia&apos;s baselines have rise by 500,000 bpd. With more supply, the question of how demand will develop remains ambiguous - arguments for both bullish and bearish narratives are convincing. [1]&lt;/li&gt;

With many American cities aiming to reduce carbon emissions, gas-fired stovetops are (weirdly enough) becoming a point of contention.

China refused to grant the US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman permission to meet with her counterpart Le Yucheng. This rebuttal comes four months after the bitter Alaska talks between Yang Jiechi and Antony Blinken; China&apos;s expectation then was most likely to &quot;reset&quot; US-China relations with the Biden administration, but each side had fundamental disagreements over the other&apos;s values and behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;

Undoubtedly a heroic breakthrough in modern medicine, mRNA vaccines bypass the protein construction phase required in making traditional vaccines. Once injected, the immune cell constructs the protein from reading the mRNA and the immune system subsequently develops antibodies matching this protein. [3] &lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[3] In traditional vaccines, the protein is constructed first, &lt;b&gt;then&lt;/b&gt; inserted into the body.&lt;/div&gt;Due to the modularity of mRNA vaccines, they are easy to produce, and reliable at that. With these advantages, Moderna believes that mRNA vaccines could be used to combat HIV/AIDS, Zika, and other viral diseases.&lt;/li&gt;

Having been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the program will launch this Friday, involving around two thousand companies that make up a seventh of global carbon emissions from fossil-fuel combustion. In contrast to other cap and trade systems that impose an absolute cap, this program will allow for some margin depending on previous years&apos; performances. [1]&lt;/li&gt;

The trend of regulatory crackdowns and increasing costs of building pipelines is forcing oil/gas industries to re-think how hydrocarbons should be transported. Some are researching novel ways of transporting them (e.g. cooking into solid pucks and transporting via road or rail), while others are expanding into renewable energy and biofuel projects.

The tweet author suggests three factors: &quot;the Leninist government&apos;s years-long crisis of legitimacy, the causes of recent hyper-inflation, the mixed politics of dissidents&quot;. Regarding the second factor, the government essentially tried to reform their two-currency system to match their plans for a tourist economy, but COVID made tourism evaporate. [4]&lt;/li&gt;

With the Chinese government banning cryptocurrency mining over alleged illicit coal mining, many have been forced to seek power for their mining operations elsewhere. One favorite destination is Kazakhstan, where miners can get electrocity for as low as 3 cents per kilo-watt hour. However, Kazakhstan&apos;s power potential is waning, given its popularity and its lack of development in energy capacity over the past twenty years. Additionally, some miners are using this opportunity to investigate greener energy sources.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[1] Michael Foucault said: &quot;Where there is power, there is resistance, and yet, or rather consequently, this resistance is never in a position of exteriority in relation to power.&quot; I first encountered this relationship between attacker, defender, and customer in cryptography. From the defender&apos;s (Amazon, Ebay, etc.) point of view, you don&apos;t want your service to be too easy to penetrate. But you also don&apos;t want to increase the friction so much that people are discouraged from using your service entirely. &lt;/div&gt;

Fraudsters are taking advantage of the difficulties in proof of correct delivery and reception; for example, in the &quot;item not received&quot; fraud, a fraudster will falsely claim that he/she did not receive his/her ordered item, consequently receiving a refund. E-commerce frauds have taken off during the pandemic especially, for social distancing measures have decreased contact between delivery drivers and receivers. Some fraud operations even provide step-by-step manuals for committing these frauds. At the same time, fraud prevention services are working overtime to create effective deterrence methods.

Despite rising crude prices, shale producers are holding back on production to return capital back to investors as demand recovers. Given that the oil and gas shares of Houston&apos;s GDP have fallen dramatically in recent years, many Houston energy companies are looking favorably upon renewable energy such as wind power. Bobby Tudor of Tudor, Pickering, Holt &amp; Co also points to emerging technologies such as carbon and hydrogen capture. [1]&lt;/li&gt;

CBAM would replace the existing emissions trading system, which compensates the aluminum industry for any carbon-related electricity costs. Aluminum producers claim that including aluminium in the CBAM will do nothing to prevent carbon leakage, or resource shuffling by competitors.[2][3]&lt;/li&gt;

The 72 total guidelines include vigorous enforcement of antitrust laws, greater scruntiny of mergers, and prevention of equipment manufacturers from restricting DIY repairs.

Given that both Sudan and Egypt depend on the Nile for farming and energy generation, GERD&apos;s second phase of filling threatens to sour relations even further. For one, the GERD retains silt, but a momentary opening of its lower gates in November caused heavy silt to block the turbines of Sudan&apos;s Roseires dam - this lead to power outages throughout Sudan. Drought and flooding remain principal concerns also.&lt;/li&gt;

The state will be requiring businesses that collect biometric information to post signs informing customers about how their data will be collected. Although weaker than Illinois&apos; Biometric Information Privacy Act, which allows residents to sue for any collection without consent, New York seems to be making steps to ensure a more deliberate approach to biometric data.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[1] In &lt;i&gt;Seeing Like A State&lt;/i&gt;, James C. Scott mentions scientific forestry and how the compression of natural complexity into a more administrative, controlled form led to uncontrollable setbacks. However, as similar as these pollination robots sound to scientific forestry, technology can be used to bypass artificial forcing-complexity-into-boxes altogether (given that the algorithm can recognize natural complexity). Nonetheless, whether this forced intrusion into the natural feedback loop between insects and plant reproduction is also ignoring levels of complexity is worth thinking about. &lt;/div&gt;

With the declining insect population, farmers are looking for ways to decrease their dependence on bees to pollinate their crops. Arugga AI Farming, an AI-first-farming-second startup based in Israel, creates robots that identify and pollinate flowers that are ready for pollination. The robots would work faster than bee and human workers while offering more control over variables. [1]&lt;/li&gt;

[2] &lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[2] I didn&apos;t read the original paper, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://zenodo.org/record/5075888#.YOZUKRMzbDK&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; it is if you are curious.&lt;/div&gt; The authors claim that Wuhan coincidentally became the epicenter, it having a large population and being a nexus point for multiple animal markets. The anti-Chinese charged suspicion of the lab-leak theory is also probabilistically dismissed, as Wuhan coincidentally houses a biosafety lab also.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[3] Part of the appeal of Clubhouse is the FOMO aspect - you miss &quot;juicy&quot; tips by not being on the platform. Is Tiktok trying to leverage FOMO? At the same time, though, I wonder if this will introduce friction to the fairly frictionless content creation system that Tiktok has (content creation on Tiktok is almost genetic, with templates and filters that can be easily replicated and altered).&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/tiktok-resumes-job-applications/&quot;&gt;Applying for a job&lt;/a&gt; on TikTok becomes a reality. Part of Tiktok&apos;s effort to connect creators with brands, applicants can submit Tiktok video resumes to apply for positions such as social media manager or sales representative. [3]&lt;/li&gt;

With a big question mark surrounding consumer demand, coffee prices at the consumer level could be affected. On the supply side, bottlenecks caused by a shortage of containers and ships may lead to growers and exporters holding on to their reserves, exacerbating the price increase. For the most part, coffee buyers are protected by forward contracts, but problems will emerge once these contracts expire.&lt;/li&gt;

The contract originally marked the Department of Defense&apos;s (DoD) attempt to move from physical to cloud-based operations. In 2019, President Donald Trump placed the contract on hold for complaints of favouritism towards Amazon. The winner was announced to be Microsoft later in the year. Amazon subsequently appealed, claiming that Trump was biased against them given Trump&apos;s known dislike of Bezos-owned The Washington Post.&lt;/li&gt;

Enzymes that are not naturally occurring are often required [2], but inventing new enzymes is no easy task. Given how complex amino acid chains are [3], the traditional process takes long and costs much, adopting an almost naive &quot;find the needle in the haystack&quot; approach. Allozyme instead aims to make the enzyme selection process more self-contained, hence reducing costs and increasing efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;

Long-term allies UAE and Saudi Arabia are expressing their differences, with the former refusing to sign the deal that extends into 2022. UAE agreed to the current baseline in April 2020, but an extension of this baseline into 2022 is undesirable, as they have invested heavily in production capacity.&lt;/li&gt;

Roach&lt;/a&gt; talks about inflation. This is an older opinion piece from May 2021, but highlights bigger themes surrounding inflation this time around. Roach remembers Arthur Burns&apos; philosophy surrounding inflation - Burns believed that price trends are largely affected by transitory noise that has nothing to do with monetary policy. Hence he sought to reduce the consumer price index (CPI) to products that were independent of noise, at one point excluding energy and food products. Only when the resulting CPI continued to rise at a double-digit rate did Burns acknowledge America&apos;s inflation problem.

	&lt;p&gt;This highlights the dangers of cherry-picking: picking &quot;nicer&quot; data points to see a desired result like a lower significance level. Furthermore, the delineation between COVID and normalcy can be dangerous; treating COVID as merely a passing phase encourages a Burns-esque philosophy that increases in various consumer products will disappear once COVID is &quot;over&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[1] I think this highlights a number of interesting things. 
		&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Power graphs (i.e. the distribution of power) are important, and they are not always equivalent to the distribution of agents.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;We sometimes forget, but software - and technology in general - is hard. The costs of implementing in-house systems for small/medium-sized businesses that are not in the tech space are far greater than just getting a third-party to take care of everything.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/a8e7c9a2-5819-424f-b087-c6f2e8f0c7a1&quot;&gt;Hackers&lt;/a&gt; hit Kaseya, an IT software provider, to spread ransomware. Consequently, many of Sweden&apos;s Coop grocery chain stores, which depend on Kaseya for their cash register and self-checkout systems, remained closed. This attack suggests the dependence of many small/medium-sized companies on centralized third parties for their IT service needs. [1]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/03/digital-violence-nso-group-spyware/&quot;&gt;Digital Forensics&lt;/a&gt; presents an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalviolence.org/#/&quot;&gt;interactive timeline&lt;/a&gt; of the state terror caused by the NSO Group&apos;s spyware &lt;i&gt;Pegasus&lt;/i&gt;. The spyware is allegedly capable of activating personal smartphone cameras and microphones, hence leveraging the widespread use of smartphones to gain intelligence. &lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[2] I&apos;m working on a thesis that as things become more niche, the need to standardize and homogenize increases also. Pegasus seems to be exploiting this thesis, if true.&lt;/div&gt; Digital Forensics developed digitalviolence to counter the use of spyware like Pegasus towards questionable, unethical purposes. [2]&lt;/li&gt;

Paraquat is a known toxic herbicide marketed by Syngenta and previously sold by USA&apos;s Chevron. A tort may arise from data showing that chronic exposure to paraquat may be correlated with Parkinson&apos;s disease.&lt;/li&gt;

[1] A primary reason for this resurgence in car ownership is the pandemic, which discouraged the use of public transportation (due to fears of viral transmission). Used car prices and waiting times for driving tests have risen. An interesting observation is that, at least in America, the total distance travelled by car is not even at pre-pandemic levels. I would guess that this discrepancy emerges from the prevalence of remote work and other stay-at-home policies.&lt;/li&gt;

OPEC+ is looking to increase oil supply in the market to ease a surge in oil prices. However, UAE have rejected this new deal on the grounds that their maximum production capacity has increased since 2018, so the proposed deal will cut into their production revenues more than it will for Russia and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[3] I really wonder how our ancestors would react if they saw 1. people getting information from these massively vast social graphs and 2. the mediators of these social graphs policing the information.&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[4] It&apos;d be cool to build a GAN with the Twitter misinformation labeller as the adversary.&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/twitter-colorful-misinformation-labels/&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; rolls out misinformation labels. The labels color-code misleading information, and include a link that takes you to a curated landing page with verified information. The role of social networks in the spread of information (true or un-true alike) is interesting. Social graphs have always been a source of information, but the constant verification of information with social origins is the fascinating bit. [3] I suspect a lot of Americans will call this a rights infringement, but that&apos;s a separate conversation altogether. [4]&lt;/li&gt;

Hydrogen blending is a method of reducing carbon emissions from natural gas by mixing hydrogen into natural gas pipelines. Apparently, there is such a thing as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen&quot;&gt;green hydrogen&lt;/a&gt;, which is hydrogen produced from low-carbon sources (as opposed to the usual fossil fuel sources). The high cost of green hydrogen production seems to be the barrier.&lt;/li&gt;

Peak energy demand may increase given the heat wave. California is most at risk because it relies on energy imports, and solar energy output falls in the late afternoon.&lt;/li&gt;

The minimum tax rate is meant to discourage multinational corporations from shifting their money to lower-tax countries.[3] Lower-tax countries such as Ireland have benefitted from the influx of investments from multi-national companies, so a final agreement could have major repurcussions.&lt;/li&gt;

COVID has led to greater acceptance of technological solutions for traditionally offline things, but I&apos;m curious how this turns out. I do think this has the most application in language learning, since being able to see a mouth sounding out words can be crucial for learning pronunciation. However, I&apos;m doubtful that putting a face to text is really more engaging.[1] Also text has the greatest signal density, so by using this presenter, the signal density goes down significantly.&lt;/li&gt;

Zipline first attacked the African space by making strides in medical supply lines, using drones to deliver vaccines and medicines to local hospitals. Using drones may not usher in a technological revolution, but it reminds me of Carlota Perez&apos;s &lt;i&gt;Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital&lt;/i&gt;; in her model, technological revolutions generally start at certain cores (US, Britain, etc.), then diffuse to the peripheries. This appears to demonstrate the opposite phenomenon. Ghana&apos;s restrictions against drones may have been more lax, hence providing a nice training ground for Zipline.&lt;/li&gt;

The psychology surrounding money is fascinating; at least in America, having a lot of money is synonymous with a good life, and I think the behaviors seen on Robinhood are in-line with this thesis.&lt;/li&gt;

A lot of Didi&apos;s ride-sharing comes from taxi-hailing rather than private-car sharing (similar to Kakao Taxi), and with Meituan and Ele.me already popular in the Chinese food delivery market, it&apos;ll be interesting to see how Didi grows.&lt;/li&gt;

This trend of wanting to know the locations of your families and friends is an interesting one. I remember it started back in the 2010s with Snapchat announcing their locations feature. Since then, I&apos;ve had multiple friends ask me to install location-sharing apps, but I never understood why someone would willingly give away his/her location. Maybe the placement of a social graph in physical space?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Basic Signal Processing Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;Waves&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;When a note is played on the piano, the sound that emanates from the piano and reaches our ears is actually a wave. As soon as the piano hammer hits the string, the air surrounding the piano string vibrates i.e. areas of low air pressure and high air pressure are created. These vibrations travel throughout the air and causes our ear drums to vibrate, causing other ear components to send signals to the brain. These signals are interpreted as &quot;sound&quot;. [1]&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[1] Not all waveforms look like the clean sine and cosine functions; any look at the stock market shows that waveforms can look extremely complicated.&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;h4&gt;Fourier Transform&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Any waveform can be broken down into its constituent sine and cosine waves (also called simple sinusoids), for which the terms &lt;b&gt;frequency&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;amplitude&lt;/b&gt; are more well-defined. For example, the waveform below is pretty irregular, so it&apos;s difficult to observe any concrete properties by just looking at it. Luckily, the Fourier Transform decomposes the waveform into simple sinusoids, from which we can observe the various frequencies that make up the waveform.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/data/fingerprint/fourier.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; width: 60%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;


		&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[2] The best of both time and frequency worlds is encapsulated in the spectrogram, which we introduce soon.&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Notice how the faded orange, green, and pink waves are just simple sinusoids with uniform frequencies and waveforms. &lt;b&gt;This is huge.&lt;/b&gt; The Fourier Transform implies that waveforms can be represented in terms of both time and frequency, each representation showing what the other cannot. [2] The canonical representation of waves is time-based, but notice that the temporal representation offers no obvious frequency information. On the other hand, the frequency representation likewise eliminates time information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Digitalization&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The above introduced the necessary tools and information for audio fingerprinting. However, music in its digital form places critical restrictions on these tools - as always, knowing when not to apply certain tools is just as important as knowing when to apply them, so we explore the relevant consequences of digitalization below.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;Sampling and its consequences&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The difference between analog and digital music may be slight for the casual music listener, but most audiophiles will acknowledge that analog music sounds warmer and deeper compared to its counterpart - this is due to the process in which analog music is converted to digital music, or sampling. Sampling transforms a continuous signal into a discrete one. [3] As a simple illustration, making a connect-the-dots puzzle from a line drawing is essentially sampling - a conversion from the continuous to the discrete.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[3] &quot;Discrete&quot; and &quot;continuous&quot; are just math jargon for &quot;chopped up&quot; and &quot;smooth&quot;, respectively.&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/data/fingerprint/sampling.png&quot;&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The specific mechanics of sampling consists of marking dots on a continuous signal at a fixed speed (called the sampling rate). But how fast should the sampling rate be such that the continuous signal can be deduced from its discretized form? We should hope that it&apos;s fast enough so that the deduction is easier than completing a connect-the-dots puzzle. A slow sample rate keeps us guessing, but a fast sample rate clearly shows the shape of the continuous signal.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/data/fingerprint/fast_slow.png&quot;&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;However, as the sample rate increases, the memory demand also increases. We&apos;re faced with a clear dilemma here: either increase the sample rate and risk taking up too much memory, or decrease the sample rate and lose data to the point that the original signal is impossible to deduce. Where is the Goldilock&apos;s zone of sampling rates for music?&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem&quot;&gt;The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem&lt;/a&gt; states that given a signal that contains no frequencies greater than \( B \) hertz, a sample rate of at least \( 2B \) samples per second is sufficient to reconstruct the continuous signal from its discretized form. Since human ears can only hear up to around 20 kHz, a sample rate of 40 kHz should be sufficient. This is where the magic number of 44.1 kHz comes from. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;It seems as though we have resolved our digitalization problem. Sampling at 44.1 kHz is sufficient, so now we should be free to analyze digital waveforms. Unfortunately, the Fourier Transform in its current form poses a major obstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h4&gt;Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)&lt;/h4&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The Fourier transform can extract frequency information only from continuous waveforms. Luckily, a discrete version of the Fourier Transform exists, the aptly-named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform&quot;&gt;Discrete Fourier Transform&lt;/a&gt;. Without going into too much technical detail, the DFT essentially bins frequency information. The frequencies that the DFT extracts are grouped together; the exact specifications of these groupings is determined by the sampling rate and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function&quot;&gt;window&lt;/a&gt;. We skip the technical details in this layman&apos;s introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;audioplay: reverse-search&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As an exercise, let&apos;s explore what is important in song identification. As studied above, the essential components of any song are frequency, time, and amplitude. 

	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amplitude.&lt;/b&gt; Clearly, the loudness (a.k.a. amplitude) is irrelevant; a song played at 10 dB is still the same song when played at 100 dB. &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Frequency.&lt;/b&gt; A song pitched up several semitones is noticeably different from the original song, so frequency should be important. Of course, the original song will be recognizable, but to say that the pitched-up version is the same as the original would be a stretch.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time.&lt;/b&gt; Similarly, a sped-up song is not the same as the original. However, overall song length is generally useless; instead, the time differences between specific moments are meaningful identifiers. For example, if a note hits earlier than you expect, then you will probably second-guess your memory. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;With these ideas in mind, the project consists of two components: fingerprinting and recognition. The first transforms sound into a common medium that we can work with, and the second pertains to the song identification itself. In other words, fingerprinting is the mise en place, while recognition is the actual cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
	
	&lt;p&gt;The project&apos;s general overview is as follows:
	&lt;ol&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Fingerprinting&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Spectrogram generation&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Peak detection&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Peak association&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Hashing&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Recognition&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Fingerprinting&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Scoring&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fingerprinting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;I. Spectrogram generation&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The spectrogram combines time and frequency information into a single representation, hence returning the time information lost through the Fourier transform. Because it compresses all the necessary information of a song into a single representation, it is the focal point of the entire fingerprinting process.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/data/fingerprint/spectro.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; width: 80%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;

	&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[4] Notice that the lower frequencies i.e. bass frequencies are especially high in amplitude. But when you listen to a song, the bass doesn&apos;t sound drastically louder than any of the other frequencies, so why are the bass frequencies so red? Because human ears are more sensitive to certain frequencies than others, sound engineers boost up the bass to make the overall track more &quot;even&quot;. For the curious, look up &quot;psychoacoustics&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The x-axis, y-axis, and the color show the time, frequency, and amplitude, respectively. Just for intuition, notice that the above spectrogram shows red spikes, where nearly all the frequencies in the entire range are firing off at a high amplitude (this is probably the snare of the song). [4]&lt;/p&gt;

	

&lt;h4&gt;II. Peak detection&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;For our purposes, the spectrogram is an image, and an image is just an \(n \times n\) array of numbers, where each pixel is a cell in the array. The time and frequency determines the cell&apos;s location, and the amplitude dictates its value. A peak is then a (time, frequency) pair with the greatest amplitude value among the pixels surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/data/fingerprint/spec_draw1.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; width: 80%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;To identify peaks, we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_morphology&quot;&gt; binary morphology&lt;/a&gt;. [5] The process is as follows:
		&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[5] Binary morphology has a lot of applications. Your drawing program probably uses binary morphology to make lines thinner or thicker, for example.&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Place a 19-by-19 pixel square \(S\) over any part of the image.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Identify the pixel with the maximum value within \(S\). Call this maximum value \(M\).&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Set all the pixel values within \(S\) to \(M\).&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Apply the following rule to every pixel in \(S\): for any pixel \(P\) in \(S\),
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If \(P = M\), color the pixel white.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If \(P \neq M\), color the pixel black.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;p&gt;For example, executing steps 1 through 3 gives the &quot;Mask Applied&quot; image [6], and the last step produces the &quot;Identified Peaks&quot; image. In the &quot;Mask Applied&quot; image, there are distinct squares, which are the 19-by-19 pixel squares described above. The &quot;Identified Peaks&quot; image shows scattered white dots on a black background, where the white dots are the maximal value pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/data/fingerprint/morphology.png&quot;&gt;

	&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[6] Values in this grayscale image range from 0 to 255, with 0 being black and 255 being white.&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Finding the peaks is then just a matter of gathering the locations i.e. (time, frequency) pairs of the white dots. You may notice that by identifying peaks, we&apos;ve lost all amplitude information, since the white dots show only the locations of the peaks. Thankfully, amplitude is not important for our purposes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;III. Peak Association&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this list of peak locations is actually sufficient for our goal to &quot;reverse-search&quot; audio. But we are greedy. Search needs to be fast, and using the vanilla list of peak locations would take absurdly long. By associating peaks with each other, we get higher information density and easy searchability at the expense of more computation. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The intuition behind peak association follows from the principle that the number of links between things increases faster than the number of things themselves. For example, there is only 1 possible link between 2 things, but 45 possible links between just 10 things.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/data/fingerprint/scale.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; width: 100%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;This means that from just a list of 10 peaks, we can extract 4 times as much information. The bang for our buck increases quadratically too, so more peaks means higher information density.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h5&gt;III-a. Anchors + Target Zones&lt;/h5&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;However, chaotically pairing all possible peaks won&apos;t be fruitful - we need order in the chaos to extract the most information possible. The pairing method is as follows:
			&lt;ol&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Order the peaks by time.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Choose a peak, and call it the anchor \(A\).&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Choose the target peaks by selecting the 10 consecutive peaks \(\{ T_1, ..., T_{10} \}\) that come after skipping the first 3 peaks that are immediately after \(A\). For example, if \(A\) is the 10th peak, then the target peaks are the 14th, 15th, ..., 23rd peaks.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Form the pair associations \( \{ (A, T_1), ..., (A, T_{10})\}. \)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Repeat by setting every peak as the anchor, insofar as the 10 target peaks exist. For example, if only 10 peaks exist, then the 10th peak cannot be an anchor peak because there are no more potential target peaks.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ol&gt;	
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/data/fingerprint/peak_assoc.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; width: 75%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The anchor point brings order to the chaos. Because every peak in the target zone is linked to a common anchor point, every target peak has a &quot;common denominator&quot;. In terms of ease of information access, there is a stark difference between saying &quot;John is friends with Anne, Bob, and Clark&quot;, versus &quot;Anne is friends with Bob, Clark is friends with John, etc&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;IV. Hashing&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this list of peak pairs isn&apos;t easily searchable, so we need a method to compress each pair into an easily searchable form. Hashing associates each pair with a unique string, akin to how license plates uniquely identify cars. Input an anchor-target pair into the hashing function, and out comes a string that uniquely identifies that pair.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Recall that we hypothesized that only time difference and frequency are essential for identification. While the specifics of the hashing function aren&apos;t important, what we input into our hashing function reflects our hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/data/fingerprint/hash.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; width: 70%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Remembering that every peak is a (time, frequency) point, for every anchor-target pair \( (A, T) \), identify:
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;\(F_{\text{anchor}} := \) frequency of anchor peak.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;\(F_{\text{target}} := \) frequency of target peak.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;\(T_{\text{offset}} := \) time difference between target peak and anchor peak.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;	

	The triple \( (F_{\text{anchor}}, F_{\text{target}}, T_{\text{offset}}) \) becomes the input. By hashing every anchor-target pair, we generate a list of strings that uniquely identifies the song and is easily searchable. Having effectively translated music into organized, searchable data, this concludes the fingerprinting process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The sous chef has mise en place-d all the ingredients, and now it&apos;s time to cook. For the rest of this section, assume that we have a database full of song fingerprints. Also, we refer to the audio clip that needs to identified as the &quot;id clip&quot;, and the database songs as the &quot;db clips&quot;. For example, we need to check if the id clip matches any of the db clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;I. Fingerprinting&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Fingerprinting translates sound into a standardized form of data, so an audio clip must first be fingerprinted before recognition so that the clip can be analyzed. Fortunately, the same fingerprinting algorithms can be used for this stage, so nothing extra needs to be added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;II. Scoring&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As an exercise, let&apos;s study how similar the fingerprints generated from two different sources playing the same song are. Both sources should generate similar spectrograms, and hence similar peaks. Therefore, the anchor-target pairs should coincide, with the only possible dissimilarities being in time and amplitude. Nonetheless, the time &lt;b&gt;differences&lt;/b&gt; between the anchor-target pairs in both should be constant. In sum, the invariant information consists of the anchor-target pair frequencies and time differences, which are exactly the inputs of the hashing function.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;[7] It&apos;s unlikely that the clip for identification is the exact same clip that was used to fingerprint the song for the database. Hence, we need to work probabilistically: which song in the database has the highest probability of being the song in the clip?&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if the song in an audio clip matches a song in the database, then the hashes must coincide. Then identification simply becomes a matter of choosing the song that has the highest number of hash matches, and we are done! [7]&lt;/p&gt;
